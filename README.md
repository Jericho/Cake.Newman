# Cake.Newman

A simple [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake) addin powered by [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) to run (and test) [Postman](https://getpostman.com) [Collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections).

You can find documentation either on [Cake's site](https://cakebuild.net/dsl/postman) or [here on GitHub](https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Newman/). This should be enough to get started with Newman even if you're not familiar with the CLI.

You may find Newman's documentation helpful as well, which can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#command-line-options).
